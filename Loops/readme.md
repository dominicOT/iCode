# Python Loops
Python loops are programming constructs that allow coders to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. 
There are two main types of loops in Python.


## for loop:
The ` for loop ` is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range. 

### Syntax
`
for item in sequence:  
    # block to be executed
`  

#### In each iteration, the loop variable (item in the example) takes the value of the next element in the sequence. The loop continues until all elements in the sequence are exhausted.

Here's an example that prints each item in a list:
`
planets = ["jupiter", "venus", "mars"]
for d in planets:
    print(planets)
`
Output:

apple
banana
cherry
